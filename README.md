# JQL

JSON Query Language (JQL - pronounced "jackal") is a query language system written in PHP for querying JSON strings and files. It also supports PHP `stdClass` objects. The "language" is heavily based on SQL, the popular database query language to allow easy adoption and quick learning, but it does have some limitations, simply because some of the advanced features of SQL are impossible to implement into such a system.
